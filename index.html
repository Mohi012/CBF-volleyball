        <h3>Team selection process</h3>

<p>As part of registration, you can choose to be a captain. Captains play a major role in selecting the team and maintaining sportsmanship within the team and beyond. 
Note: It is recommended to volunteer as captain only if you know and are aware of most of the players and their skills.
<br><br>
Once the registration is complete, we will determine the number of teams based on the total number of participants.
<br><br>
A separate WhatsApp group will be created for all participants.
<br><br>
If the number of captain submissions exceeds the number of teams, a poll will be posted in the participants group to finalize the captains.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Between registration close and team selection dates:</h3>
<br><br>
We will randomly select five people, who will remain anonymous, and who are familiar with most of the registered participants. These individuals will assign points (100, 75, 50, 25) to all players based on their skill levels, observed during previous tournaments or practice games. Each of the five evaluators will assign skill points separately. We will then average these scores and round them to the closest skill point value for each player and assign them to specific category/roster. 
<br><br><br>
<h3>On the day of selection (assume we need 6 teams with finalized 6 captains)</h3>
<br><br>
Captains will each receive 400 points. They will then deduct their own assigned points and use the remainder to select the remaining five players for their team. (Ex: if I was assigned at 75 skill point level, as captain I will have 325 pts remaining to spend on 5 players).
<br><br>
Chits numbered 1 to 6 will be presented to the captains. Theyâ€™ll each pick one and proceed to pick a player from the roster.
<br><br>
Repeat the above step 4 more times until the teams are full with 6 players.
<br><br>
Captains should plan properly to spend 400 points and fill their team.
<br><br>
No changes after the teams are formed.</p>
